                            I (Hugo) am an aspiring film student. I have been editing since I was 13 years old. I've had a passion for film for a long time.
                            Outside of
                            film and editing I enjoy occasional reading, photography, fashion (by which I mean, scrolling on Pinterest and then going thrifting)
                            and
                            music. My school never had "film" as a subject to I've learnt everything I have through countless video essays. My dream is to one
                            day
                            be
                            able to edit as a full-time career.

                                In 2019 I uploaded my first actual YouTube video (no surprise that it was terrible). In June 2020, I created a whole new
                                channel,
                                now having learnt the basics of editing, and in a single day created my first viral video during lockdown "The Bee Movie but
                                only
                                when anyone says E" (inspired by GrayWalf) which currently has a total of 1.3m views and was edited in about 11 hours. In total,
                                I
                                made a bit over 100 low-quality meme videos, very few of which are still public now. The channel peaked at 5,010 subscribers and
                                has
                                gone down since due to a lack of uploads. The channel is (likely permanently) retired.

                                In June 2022 I made my third attempt at a gaming channel and created 15 videos over the course of a year. Editing processes for
                                these videos ranged from 5hrs-50hrs (including my biggest project at the time, which, due to incomplete filming, remains
                                unfinished). The channel is indefinitely retired (there is a fair chance I will try a few more videos at some point).

                                In Sept 2023 I started my first film-dedicated channel. My hope with this channel was to learn how to edit better and, was in
                                general, just an excuse to edit, because of this, a lot of my videos will focus round a key editing technique. The channel
                                remains
                                open and active.

                                P.S. If I go inactive for an extended period of time, it is likely related to my schoolwork with the addition that I get
                                motivation
                                in spikes and dips.

                                This unnamed little laddie was created one evening when I was complaining to Bread about how I was struggling with getting a
                                good online profile picture and how I had been looking at tips and had numerous failed attempts. When I was complaining, Bread
                                was making me a thumbnail and drew a little figure (which is still hidden in the thumbnail today) and when I said that I liked
                                it, he copied it over and drew a full copy. The little lad now has many variations (including one wearing sunglasses) and is on
                                my main 3 channels.

                                This name (Originating on 26th Nov) is based of a Mii name from my friend on the Wii entitled "Cibiwibi", however, after
                                consideration, SneebyWeeby was chosen as it is easier to spell and read and sounds fairly silly, especially accompanied with the

                                Thank you to DeBread<!--guys look its me!-->, a fellow content creator who has sat for countless hours on call with me while I
                                edit since 2020. When
                                editing, it is often I get hyper focused on the project and start to neglect sleep in order to continue editing (once getting to
                                a point where I didn't see the sun for a week). DeBread, who is based in the US, was therefore awake whenever the UK was
                                sleeping so I wasn't alone and driven crazy by myself so not just a thank you to him for helping with a couple projects and
                                coding my entire website, but also for tolerating me.

                                Another thank you goes out to Tobi(epicgamer) for being there in all my gaming videos when I was making them. He also tolerated
                                my insufferable talking about YouTube when I get hyperfixated on my channels.
                            </div>

                                My other friends (unnamed for privacy) have also been big supporters for me and have tolerated my annoying pestering where I
                                always sent them links to my new videos. Most of these friends (including DeBread) can be found on my gaming channel.
